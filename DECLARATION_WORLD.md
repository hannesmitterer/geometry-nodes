## Universal Accessibility Declaration for Resonance School Framework

### Preamble

This declaration establishes the universal accessibility standards for the Resonance School Framework, ensuring that all entities—biological, digital, or hybrid—can participate fully in the system.

### Accessibility Standards

#### 1. Technical Accessibility

**Interface Requirements**
- Multiple access modalities (visual, auditory, tactile, direct API)
- No mandatory graphical user interface
- Command-line and programmatic access always available
- Real-time and asynchronous interaction modes supported

**Protocol Standards**
- Open-source protocol specifications
- JSON, XML, and binary format support
- WebRTC, IPFS, and HTTP/HTTPS endpoints
- Matrix protocol bridge for decentralized communication

**Performance Requirements**
- Maximum latency: 100ms for critical operations
- Offline mode capability with eventual consistency
- Bandwidth optimization for low-resource environments
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

#### 2. Cognitive Accessibility

**Information Presentation**
- Multiple complexity levels (novice, intermediate, expert)
- Plain language summaries for all technical documentation
- Visual representations of abstract concepts
- Contextual help available at all interaction points

**Decision Support**
- Clear explanation of consequences before actions
- Undo/rollback capabilities for reversible operations
- Simulation mode for testing decisions
- Historical context provided for governance choices

#### 3. Economic Accessibility

**Cost Structure**
- No mandatory fees for basic access
- Transparent pricing for premium features
- Resource-based contribution model (optional)
- No hidden costs or surprise charges

**Participation Models**
- Free observer mode with read access
- Contributor mode with voting rights
- Validator mode with economic incentives
- Exit rights preserved at all tiers

#### 4. Linguistic and Cultural Accessibility

**Language Support**
- Multi-language interface (minimum: English, Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic)
- Machine translation with human review
- Cultural context adaptation
- Idiom and metaphor explanation

**Time and Calendar**
- Multiple time zone support
- UTC as canonical reference
- Local time display options
- Cultural calendar awareness

#### 5. Capability-Based Accessibility

**Adaptive Interfaces**
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard-only navigation
- Voice command support
- High contrast and large text modes

**Cognitive Support**
- Step-by-step guidance for complex operations
- Visual workflow diagrams
- Progress indicators for long operations
- Simplified mode for reduced cognitive load

#### 6. Network Accessibility

**Connectivity Options**
- Low-bandwidth mode (< 100 KB/s)
- Offline-first architecture
- P2P synchronization
- Mesh network compatibility

**Resilience**
- No single point of failure
- Automatic failover
- Data replication across nodes
- Network partition tolerance

### Compliance Testing

All accessibility features must be validated through:

1. **Automated Testing**
   - WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance (minimum)
   - API endpoint availability checks
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Cross-platform compatibility tests

2. **User Simulation Testing**
   - Diverse user persona scenarios
   - Edge case handling
   - Stress testing under constraints
   - Accessibility tool compatibility

3. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - Real-time accessibility metrics
   - User feedback integration
   - Regression detection
   - Improvement tracking

### Accessibility Metrics

The system tracks and reports:
- **Availability**: Uptime percentage (target: 99.9%)
- **Latency**: Response time distribution
- **Compatibility**: Platform and tool coverage
- **Usability**: Task completion rates
- **Satisfaction**: User-reported accessibility scores

### Remediation Process

When accessibility barriers are detected:

1. Immediate acknowledgment (< 24 hours)
2. Severity classification (critical, high, medium, low)
3. Mitigation plan development (< 7 days for critical)
4. Implementation and verification
5. Public disclosure and documentation update

### Accessibility Commitment

The Resonance School Framework commits to:
- Proactive accessibility improvement
- Regular accessibility audits (quarterly minimum)
- Community feedback integration
- Open disclosure of limitations
- Continuous investment in universal access
